# Simon-s-Algorithm
<p>Simon's Algorithm is usually presented with a secret structure of s=11; so I took the s=110 implementation and translated it into OpenQASM.</p>
<p>Read <a href='https://agentanakinai.wordpress.com/2019/09/16/simons-algorithm/'>this blog article</a> for an explanation of this experiment.</p>
